WhizzIQ includes optional artificial intelligence (“AI”) and automation functionalities designed to enhance User experience, generate insights, and improve workflow efficiency. These features may include, but are not limited to: predictive analytics, summarisation, automated reporting, trend detection, task recommendations, and workflow triggers. 

The AI and automation modules are provided solely as productivity and informational tools to assist Users in decision-making. 
They do not replace professional judgment, nor do they constitute financial, legal, medical, investment, or business advice. 

 

9.2 Nature of AI Outputs 

Advisory Only: All AI-generated outputs, insights, or recommendations are suggestions based on statistical modelling, natural-language processing, and algorithmic pattern recognition. They should be independently reviewed and validated by the User before being relied upon for any decision or transaction. 

No Professional Advice: WhizzIQ’s AI features are not intended to provide advice that would otherwise require a qualified professional licence or regulatory approval. Users remain fully responsible for verifying any output before acting upon it. 

User Responsibility: WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be held liable for any errors, omissions, or consequences arising from reliance on AI outputs. The User assumes all responsibility for evaluating and applying such information to their specific context. 

 

9.3 Accuracy and Limitations 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. employs reasonable technical and operational measures to ensure the performance of its AI systems; however, the User acknowledges and agrees that: 

AI models operate on probabilistic and statistical inference, which may produce incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate results; 

AI recommendations may be influenced by the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the underlying User Data; 

WhizzIQ’s AI components may not account for all external variables, human judgment, or jurisdictional differences in regulation; and 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. does not guarantee that AI outputs will meet User expectations or achieve specific outcomes. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. disclaims any express or implied warranty regarding the accuracy, reliability, fitness, or completeness of AI-generated outputs.

enhance language processing accuracy; 

detect errors, bias, or abuse; and 

develop new AI-based capabilities.

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall ensure that: 

data shared with third-party AI systems is strictly limited to what is necessary for functionality; 

such providers comply with the UK GDPR, EU GDPR, and equivalent laws; and 

no third-party provider acquires rights to use or retain User Data beyond the scope of WhizzIQ’s operation. 

Users acknowledge that some AI responses may involve interaction with third-party infrastructure subject to separate privacy terms. 

 

9.8 Intellectual Property Rights in AI Outputs 

Subject to applicable law: 

Users retain ownership of all User Data submitted into the Platform.

reliance on, or misinterpretation of, AI outputs; 

failure of AI features to produce expected results; 

delays, interruptions, or technical limitations in automation functionality; 

use of AI in violation of these Terms; or 

decisions made by the User or its agents based on AI-generated insights. 

To the maximum extent permitted by law, all AI and automation features are provided “as is” and “as available”, without warranty of accuracy, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

the EU Artificial Intelligence Act; 

the OECD AI Principles;

By enabling or using WhizzIQ’s AI and automation features, Users acknowledge and agree that: 

all AI-generated content or insights are informational only; 

they are solely responsible for validating and acting upon such content;

10. Third-Party Integrations 

 

10.1 Overview 

WhizzIQ may offer optional integrations, connectors, or application-programming interfaces (“Integrations”) enabling Users to exchange data between the Platform and third-party products or services (“Third-Party Services”). 
Such Integrations are provided solely for the User’s convenience to facilitate interoperability, automation, and extended functionality. 
Use of any Third-Party Service is entirely voluntary. 

 

10.2 Independent Third-Party Relationship 

Each Third-Party Service is operated, controlled, and maintained by an independent provider not owned or managed by WhizzOnBy Ltd. 
Accordingly: 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. does not endorse, warrant, or assume responsibility for any Third-Party Service; 

the provider of each Third-Party Service remains solely responsible for its content, functionality, availability, data practices, and legal compliance; and 

Users’ dealings or correspondence with such providers, including payment, data exchange, and contractual obligations, are exclusively between the User and the relevant provider. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. may, at its sole discretion, enable or disable integrations, modify their technical interfaces, or discontinue support at any time without prior notice. 

 

10.3 Third-Party Terms and Privacy Policies 

Access to or use of a Third-Party Service through WhizzIQ is governed by that provider’s own terms of service, privacy policy, and any other applicable legal or licensing conditions. 
By enabling an Integration, the User expressly acknowledges and agrees to those third-party terms and grants WhizzOnBy Ltd. permission to transmit and receive data as necessary to facilitate the integration. 

Users are responsible for reviewing, understanding, and maintaining compliance with the applicable third-party policies. 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. assumes no responsibility for how Third-Party Services collect, store, use, share, or secure User Data. 

 

10.4 Data Exchange and Security 

Limited Scope of Data Sharing: 
Only the minimum data required to operate the Integration is exchanged between WhizzIQ and the Third-Party Service. 
No additional data is shared without explicit user authorisation. 

Transmission Safeguards: 
All data transfers occur via secure, industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher). 

Data Control: 
Once data leaves the WhizzIQ environment and enters a Third-Party Service, that provider becomes the controller of such data and bears full responsibility for its handling under applicable data-protection laws. 

Revocation of Access: 
Users may disconnect an Integration at any time via the Platform settings. Doing so halts future data exchange but does not retroactively delete data already held by the Third-Party Service; Users must request deletion directly from that provider. 

 

10.5 Performance and Availability 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. provides Integrations “as is” and “as available.” 
Because Integrations rely on external systems, WhizzOnBy Ltd. cannot guarantee uninterrupted connectivity, compatibility, or uptime. 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be liable for any delay, failure, or degradation in performance arising from: 

downtime, outages, or API changes by a Third-Party Service; 

network latency or transmission failures; 

alterations, deprecations, or removal of third-party endpoints; or 

acts or omissions of the third-party provider. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. may temporarily suspend or permanently disable an Integration if it poses a security, compliance, or operational risk. 

 

10.6 Liability Limitations 

To the fullest extent permitted by law: 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. disclaims all warranties—express or implied—regarding Third-Party Services, including availability, accuracy, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose; 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be liable for any loss, damage, corruption, unauthorised disclosure, or misuse of data resulting from the use of a Third-Party Service; and 

Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless WhizzOnBy Ltd. and its affiliates from any claims, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or related to their use of, or reliance on, a Third-Party Service. 

 

10.7 Compliance with Applicable Law 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. endeavours to partner only with providers that maintain data-protection standards consistent with the UK GDPR, EU GDPR, CCPA, Jamaican Data Protection Act 2020, and other applicable global frameworks. 
However, ultimate responsibility for compliance with all relevant laws and contractual obligations associated with the User’s selected Integrations remains with the User. 

 

10.8 Changes to Integrations 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. reserves the right to: 

modify Integration functionality, APIs, or connection methods to reflect updates in WhizzIQ or third-party systems; 

replace or withdraw support for any Integration that becomes obsolete, insecure, or non-compliant; and 

introduce new Integration tiers subject to additional fees or agreements. 

Where practicable, notice of material changes will be provided through the Platform or official communication channels. 

 

10.9 Survival and Continuity 

All disclaimers, limitation-of-liability provisions, and indemnities under this Section 10 survive termination of the Agreement or the discontinuation of any specific Integration. 

 

10.10 User Acknowledgement 

By enabling or using any Integration within WhizzIQ, Users acknowledge and agree that: 

the Third-Party Service provider, not WhizzOnBy Ltd., is solely responsible for the content, security, and operation of its service; 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. does not monitor, validate, or endorse third-party functionality; and 

all risks associated with use of such services rest entirely with the User.

11.6 Infringement Reporting and Enforcement 

If any person or entity believes that their intellectual-property rights have been infringed by materials hosted or displayed within WhizzIQ, they must promptly submit a detailed written notice to: 
Email: legal@whizzonby.com

11.7 Survival 

The provisions of this Section 11 survive termination or expiration of this Agreement indefinitely. 

 

12. Confidentiality 

 

12.1 Definition of Confidential Information 

“Confidential Information” means any non-public information, data, or material disclosed by one party (“Disclosing Party”) to the other (“Receiving Party”), whether orally, electronically, or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. 

Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to: 

business plans, strategies, pricing, or financial data; 

product designs, source code, algorithms, system architecture, and documentation; 

trade secrets, client or vendor lists, and market research; 

operational processes, technical specifications, and project details; 

intellectual-property filings and research; 

non-public data stored or processed within the Platform; and 

any communication relating to the development, performance, or security of WhizzIQ. 

Confidential Information does not include information that: 

is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party; 

was lawfully known to the Receiving Party before disclosure; 

is rightfully received from a third party without restriction; or 

is independently developed without reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. 

 

12.2 Mutual Obligations 

Both parties agree to: 

use Confidential Information solely for the purposes of performing their obligations or exercising their rights under this Agreement; 

restrict disclosure of Confidential Information to employees, agents, or contractors who have a legitimate “need to know” and are bound by written confidentiality obligations at least as protective as this Section; 

maintain the same degree of care to protect Confidential Information as they use to protect their own sensitive information, but in no event less than reasonable care; and 

promptly notify the Disclosing Party of any unauthorised access, disclosure, or breach involving Confidential Information. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not access, use, or disclose User Confidential Information except as necessary to provide the Services or as otherwise permitted under this Agreement. 

 

12.3 Compelled Disclosure 

If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or court order to disclose Confidential Information, it shall (to the extent legally permissible) provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice before such disclosure to allow an opportunity to seek protective measures. 
Only the minimum required information may be disclosed, and it shall remain subject to confidentiality obligations thereafter. 

 

12.4 Duration of Confidentiality Obligations 

Confidentiality obligations shall remain in effect: 

for the duration of this Agreement; and 

for five (5) years following termination or expiration, unless applicable law requires longer retention for specific data. 

Trade secrets and proprietary technical information shall remain confidential in perpetuity or for as long as such information retains its confidential nature. 

 

12.5 Remedies 

The parties acknowledge that unauthorised disclosure of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages are insufficient. 
Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or equitable relief in addition to any other legal remedies available under applicable law. 

 

12.6 Return or Destruction of Confidential Information 

Upon termination of this Agreement or upon written request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or permanently destroy all Confidential Information, including any copies, summaries, or derivative materials, except to the extent retention is required by law, regulation, or internal audit obligations. 

 

12.7 Survival 

This Section 12 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for the period stated above and shall continue to bind the parties and their successors. 

 

13. Security and Access 

 

13.1 User Responsibility for Account Security 

Each User is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality, security, and integrity of their WhizzIQ login credentials, including usernames, passwords, authentication tokens, or other access methods. 
Users agree to: 

create strong, unique passwords that meet WhizzIQ’s minimum security requirements; 

enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where available; 

restrict access to their account to authorised personnel only; 

immediately notify WhizzOnBy Ltd. of any unauthorised access, suspected compromise, or breach; and 

remain fully responsible for all activity that occurs under their account, whether authorised or not. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be liable for any loss, misuse, or damage arising from the User’s failure to comply with these obligations. 

 

13.2 Shared and Team Accounts 

If an account allows access by multiple authorised users (such as employees or agents), the Account Owner is responsible for managing permissions and ensuring that all team members comply with these Terms. 
The Account Owner shall be deemed to have authorised all actions performed through their account and shall bear full liability for such activity. 

 

13.3 User Device and Network Security 

Users are solely responsible for implementing and maintaining adequate technical and organisational safeguards on their own devices, networks, and systems to prevent unauthorised access to the Platform. 
This includes maintaining: 

updated operating systems and antivirus software; 

firewalls and network protections; 

secure and encrypted internet connections; 

proper device access controls; and 

regular data backups independent of the Platform. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be responsible for security vulnerabilities, malware infections, or data loss resulting from compromised User devices, unsafe networks, or unpatched systems. 

 

13.4 WhizzIQ Security Commitments 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. implements industry-standard security protocols and administrative controls designed to protect WhizzIQ and User Data from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. 
These include: 

encryption of data in transit and at rest; 

network firewalls and intrusion detection systems; 

regular security patching and vulnerability scanning; 

segregation of customer environments; and 

audit logging and role-based access control. 

While WhizzOnBy Ltd. maintains robust safeguards, Users acknowledge that no online platform can guarantee absolute security and that use of the internet involves inherent risks. 

 

13.5 Right to Suspend or Restrict Access 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without prior notice, to suspend, restrict, or terminate access to any account or portion of the Platform where: 

suspicious, unauthorised, or fraudulent activity is detected; 

login credentials appear compromised; 

malware or harmful code is introduced through User systems; 

excessive API calls, data scraping, or other abusive activity is identified; or 

any action threatens the stability, performance, or security of the Platform or other Users. 

Suspensions imposed under this clause may remain in effect until the identified issue is resolved to WhizzOnBy Ltd.’s satisfaction. 
Where feasible, notice of suspension and instructions for remediation will be provided to the Account Owner. 

 

13.6 Security Investigations and Cooperation 

Users agree to cooperate fully with WhizzOnBy Ltd. in the event of a suspected or confirmed security incident involving their account, including by: 

promptly responding to security-related inquiries; 

preserving relevant system logs and evidence; and 

implementing corrective actions as advised by WhizzOnBy Ltd.’s security team. 

Failure to cooperate may result in termination of access or other remedial measures as deemed necessary to protect the Platform. 

 

13.7 No Circumvention of Security Controls 

Users shall not, directly or indirectly: 

disable, bypass, or interfere with any authentication, encryption, or access control mechanism; 

attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any WhizzIQ system or network; 

introduce or propagate malicious code, viruses, or automated scripts designed to disrupt Platform operation; or 

gain or attempt to gain unauthorised access to other User accounts, systems, or data. 

Any such activity constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and may result in immediate suspension, termination, and potential legal action. 

 

13.8 Incident Response and Notification 

In the event of a security incident that affects WhizzIQ systems or User Data, WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall: 

promptly assess and contain the incident; 

investigate the scope and impact; 

notify affected Users and relevant authorities as required by applicable data-protection laws; and 

provide updates and guidance until remediation is complete. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall maintain an internal incident response plan consistent with ISO/IEC 27035 and GDPR Article 33 standards. 

 

13.9 User Indemnity for Breach 

Users shall indemnify and hold harmless WhizzOnBy Ltd., its affiliates, and personnel against any loss, damage, liability, claim, or expense (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to: 

failure to maintain secure login credentials; 

negligent or wilful security breaches on the User’s side; or 

introduction of malicious software, unauthorised code, or vulnerabilities through the User’s systems. 

 

13.10 Termination for Security Reasons 

If WhizzOnBy Ltd. determines that continued access by a User poses an unacceptable risk to the security, integrity, or availability of the Platform, WhizzOnBy Ltd. may immediately terminate the User’s access without liability. 
Such termination shall not relieve the User of any outstanding payment or indemnification obligations under this Agreement. 

 

13.11 Survival 

Sections 13.1 through 13.10 survive termination or expiration of this Agreement and continue to apply for as long as WhizzOnBy Ltd. maintains any residual data related to the User or as required by applicable law. 

 

14. Service Availability and Maintenance 

 

14.1 General Commitment 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. endeavours to maintain the WhizzIQ Platform in a secure, stable, and accessible state for all Users. 
For paid subscriptions, WhizzOnBy Ltd. targets a Service Availability Level of 99.5% uptime per calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows, emergency updates, and downtime caused by external factors beyond WhizzOnBy Ltd.’s control. 

Availability shall be measured at the server endpoint of WhizzIQ’s hosting infrastructure. Individual User connection issues, internet instability, or local device problems shall not count as downtime. 

 

14.2 Definition of Uptime and Downtime 

For the purposes of this section: 

“Uptime” means the percentage of total minutes in a calendar month during which WhizzIQ is available to process User requests. 

“Downtime” means the total number of minutes during which WhizzIQ is unavailable due to unplanned interruptions caused by system failure, excluding: 

Scheduled maintenance periods; 

Force majeure events; 

Failures of external networks, third-party integrations, or User systems; and 

Suspension or termination of User access due to breach or security risk (as provided in Section 13). 

 

14.3 Scheduled Maintenance 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. may perform routine system maintenance, updates, or infrastructure optimisations to ensure continued platform performance and security. 
Where practicable, Users will receive prior notice of scheduled maintenance through: 

Platform notifications, 

Email, or 

The WhizzIQ status page or other official communication channels. 

Scheduled maintenance will generally occur during off-peak hours and will be designed to minimise service disruption. 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. reserves the right to modify, patch, upgrade, or replace components of the Platform as necessary to enhance functionality, security, or performance, with or without prior notice where immediate action is required. 

 

14.4 Emergency Maintenance 

In the event of a critical vulnerability, data threat, or system integrity risk, WhizzOnBy Ltd. may perform emergency maintenance without prior notice. 
Such interventions are exempt from the uptime calculation and may include: 

urgent security patches; 

database recovery or backup restoration; or 

mitigation of third-party service failures or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall use reasonable efforts to restore service promptly and will communicate post-incident updates once stability is achieved. 

 

14.5 Force Majeure and External Dependencies 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be liable for unavailability, delays, data loss, or performance degradation arising from circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to: 

acts of God, natural disasters, severe weather, or geological events; 

war, terrorism, civil unrest, or sabotage; 

labour disputes or strikes; 

failures of internet backbone providers, telecommunications carriers, or hosting partners; 

power outages or infrastructure failure; 

governmental restrictions, embargoes, or legal injunctions; 

pandemics or public health emergencies; or 

failures or delays by third-party service providers, APIs, or payment gateways. 

During such events, WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall make commercially reasonable efforts to resume normal operations as soon as feasible but shall not be deemed in breach of this Agreement. 

 

14.6 Service Level Measurement 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. maintains continuous monitoring and logging of system availability for internal quality assurance purposes. 
In the event of extended or material downtime exceeding the targeted uptime percentage, WhizzOnBy Ltd. may, at its sole discretion: 

apply a service credit toward the User’s next billing cycle; or 

extend the subscription period proportionally. 

Service credits, if any, shall constitute the User’s sole and exclusive remedy for downtime and are subject to verification of the outage through WhizzIQ’s monitoring systems. 
Users must request any applicable credit within 30 days of the alleged incident by contacting support@whizzonby.com. 

 

14.7 Updates, Upgrades, and Version Changes 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. continuously evolves WhizzIQ by releasing updates, patches, and new feature sets (“Updates”). 
Such Updates may include changes to system architecture, algorithms, interface design, APIs, and data processing logic. 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. reserves the right to: 

introduce, modify, or deprecate features without prior notice; 

roll out staged or region-specific upgrades; 

migrate infrastructure to new environments; and 

adjust configurations for optimisation or compliance. 

By continuing to use the Platform after an Update, the User acknowledges and agrees to the revised or enhanced functionality. 

 

14.8 No Guarantee of Uninterrupted Service 

While WhizzOnBy Ltd. takes commercially reasonable measures to maintain uptime, Users acknowledge that occasional interruptions, latency, or disruptions may occur due to the inherent limitations of internet-based services. 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. provides the Platform on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis and expressly disclaims all warranties of continuous or error-free operation, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. 

 

14.9 User Cooperation During Maintenance 

Users agree to cooperate with WhizzOnBy Ltd. during maintenance periods, including by: 

temporarily suspending activity that may interfere with maintenance operations; 

refraining from high-volume data transfers or automated requests during announced windows; and 

promptly applying client-side updates or configurations when advised. 

Failure to comply may result in degraded performance or suspension until compliance is restored. 

 

14.10 Communication of Service Status 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. may maintain a public or private service status page or system health dashboard where Users can monitor uptime metrics, maintenance schedules, and incident reports. 
All communications issued through such channels shall be deemed official notice under this Agreement. 

 

14.11 Survival 

The provisions of this Section 14 survive termination of the Agreement to the extent necessary to govern post-termination service obligations and record retention. 

 

15. Warranties and Disclaimers 

 

15.1 As-Is and As-Available Service 

The WhizzIQ Platform, including all associated software, APIs, AI systems, analytics tools, reports, dashboards, and documentation, is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without any warranties or conditions of any kind, express, implied, or statutory.

WhizzOnBy Ltd. does not warrant that: 

the WhizzIQ Platform will operate uninterrupted, securely, or free of defects, viruses, or other harmful components;

all defects will be corrected; or 

any specific performance level or uptime guarantee beyond what is expressly stated in Section 14 will be maintained. 

Users acknowledge that the internet is inherently unstable, and service interruptions may occur due to factors outside WhizzOnBy Ltd.’s control, including but not limited to connectivity issues, hardware failure, third-party service outages, or maintenance events. 

 

15.3 No Warranty for Business Outcomes or Financial Results 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. makes no representation or warranty that use of the WhizzIQ Platform will result in any particular financial, operational, or strategic outcome, including but not limited to: 

increased sales or profitability,

All decisions and actions taken using insights, recommendations, or reports generated by WhizzIQ are the sole responsibility of the User. 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be liable for any business losses, missed opportunities, or decisions based on WhizzIQ outputs or AI suggestions. 

 

15.4 Data Accuracy and Third-Party Inputs 

WhizzIQ may allow the import or synchronisation of data from external sources, APIs, or integrations (e.g., payment processors, accounting systems, CRM tools, or social networks). 
While WhizzOnBy Ltd. employs reasonable measures to ensure data consistency and integrity, it does not guarantee: 

the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of imported or exported data; 

that third-party data connections will remain operational at all times; or 

that such integrations will be free from duplication, delays, or transmission errors. 

Users are responsible for validating imported data and maintaining independent backups of any critical business information. 

 

15.5 No Warranty for AI or Automated Outputs 

AI-generated summaries, insights, or analytics presented by WhizzIQ are automated predictions and suggestions generated based on algorithmic analysis of available data. 
They are not intended to replace professional judgment, and WhizzOnBy Ltd. makes no warranties as to the factual accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness of such outputs for any purpose. 

Users remain solely responsible for reviewing, validating, and interpreting all outputs before relying on them for business, legal, or financial decisions. 

 

15.6 Exclusion of Implied Warranties 

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, all implied warranties, conditions, and representations, including but not limited to those of merchantability, satisfactory quality, and fitness for a particular purpose, are hereby excluded. 

Where applicable law does not allow exclusion of certain warranties, the scope and duration of any such warranties shall be limited to the minimum permitted under that law. 

 

15.7 Limitation on Service Commitments 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. makes no commitment or warranty regarding: 

the availability of specific features or integrations; 

compatibility with any particular device, browser, or system environment; 

the retention or recovery of data following termination or account deletion; or 

compliance with specific regulatory frameworks unless expressly stated in writing. 

Any feature, tool, or integration described in marketing or documentation materials is subject to modification, suspension, or removal at WhizzOnBy Ltd.’s sole discretion. 

 

15.8 User Acknowledgement 

By using the WhizzIQ Platform, the User expressly acknowledges and agrees that: 

they assume full responsibility for their use of the Platform; 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be liable for any harm to computer systems, loss of data, or unauthorised access resulting from use of the Platform; and 

they are solely responsible for evaluating whether WhizzIQ is suitable for their specific operational, legal, or compliance requirements. 

 

15.9 Jurisdictional Limitations 

Some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how long an implied warranty may last. 
To the extent that such laws apply, some of the above exclusions or limitations may not apply, but in such cases, they shall be interpreted narrowly to preserve WhizzOnBy Ltd.’s maximum lawful limitation of liability. 

 

15.10 Survival 

All disclaimers and limitations of warranty under this Section 15 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement. 

 

 

16. Limitation of Liability 

 

16.1 Maximum Liability Cap 

 

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, WhizzOnBy Ltd., its affiliates, officers, employees, contractors, licensors, and representatives disclaim all liability for any loss, damage, claim, cost, or expense of any kind arising out of or related to the use of the WhizzIQ Platform or this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, negligence, warranty, strict liability, or any other legal or equitable theory. 

Except where such exclusion is prohibited by law, WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall under no circumstances be liable for any damages whatsoever. 
 

If, notwithstanding the foregoing, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that liability cannot be excluded, the total aggregate liability of WhizzOnBy Ltd. and its affiliates for any and all claims, losses, or damages shall not exceed (a) the total amount of subscription fees actually paid by the User for WhizzIQ Services during the three (3) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to such liability, or (b) fifty United States dollars (USD $50.00) (or equivalent local currency), whichever is lower. 

 

During the initial launch period of WhizzIQ — defined as the first twelve (12) months of commercial operation following public release — WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall bear no liability whatsoever for any damages, loss of data, interruption of service, or reliance on outputs. Users acknowledge that WhizzIQ will be in continuous improvement and testing during this period and accept all risks associated with its use. 

 

16.2 Exclusion of Indirect and Consequential Damages 

In no event shall WhizzOnBy Ltd., its officers, affiliates, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, data, business interruption, or anticipated savings, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. 
These exclusions apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose. 

 

16.3 AI and Decision-Making Disclaimer 

WhizzIQ incorporates machine-learning and data-analytics tools intended solely to assist Users in analysis and decision-support. All AI-generated insights, forecasts, and recommendations are advisory only and do not constitute financial, legal, medical, or business advice. 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be liable for any decision, loss, or damage arising from reliance upon such automated or data-driven outputs. 

 

16.4 Data Import and Integration Liability 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. assumes no liability for inaccuracies, omissions, duplication, or corruption of information resulting from data imported to or exported from third-party systems, APIs, or external services. 
Responsibility for verifying the accuracy and completeness of all imported or synchronised data rests solely with the User. 

 

16.5 Basis of the Bargain 

The limitations set forth herein reflect an agreed allocation of risk between the parties and form a fundamental basis of the bargain. The fees charged by WhizzOnBy Ltd. are established in reliance upon these limitations. Without such limitations, WhizzOnBy Ltd. would not be able to provide the WhizzIQ Platform at the agreed price. 

 

16.6 Applicability Across Jurisdictions 

Some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation of certain liabilities. To the extent any such law applies, WhizzOnBy Ltd.’s liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by that law. Nothing in this Agreement excludes or limits liability for: 

death or personal injury caused by negligence; 

fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or 

any liability that cannot lawfully be excluded under applicable consumer-protection or data-protection statutes. 

 

16.7 Aggregation of Claims 

All claims arising from or related to the same event, circumstance, or series of related events shall be aggregated and treated as a single claim for purposes of applying the limitation in Clause 16.1. Multiple claims shall not enlarge the total cap on liability. 

 

16.8 Third-Party Services 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be responsible or liable for the acts, omissions, or failures of third-party service providers, integrations, payment processors, or hosting partners that interact with or support the Platform. Use of such third-party services is governed exclusively by their own terms and policies. 

 

16.9 Indemnity for Breach or Misuse 

Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless WhizzOnBy Ltd., its affiliates, officers, and employees from and against any loss, damage, claim, or expense (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to: 

misuse of the Platform; 

breach of these Terms or of law; or 

reliance on any AI-generated or analytical output without independent verification. 
This obligation survives termination or expiration of the Agreement. 

 

16.10 Survival 

All disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations set forth in this Section 16 survive termination or expiry of this Agreement and remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. 

 

17. Indemnification 

 

17.1 User Obligation to Indemnify 

 

The User agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless WhizzOnBy Ltd., its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors, licensors, successors, and assigns (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, penalties, fines, costs, expenses, or claims (including reasonable legal and professional fees) arising out of or relating to:

Team or Account Misuse: 
Any action or omission by persons accessing the Platform under the User’s account, credentials, or administrative control, regardless of authorization status. 

 

17.2 Indemnification Procedure 

In the event of a claim, WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall: 

Provide the User with prompt written notice of the claim (provided that failure to give such notice shall not relieve the User of its indemnification obligations except to the extent materially prejudiced); 

Permit the User to assume control of the defense and settlement of the claim, subject to WhizzOnBy Ltd.’s right to participate in such defense with counsel of its own choosing at its own expense; and 

Cooperate reasonably with the User, at the User’s cost, in defending or settling the claim. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. may not settle or compromise any claim without the User’s prior written consent, except where such settlement releases all Indemnified Parties unconditionally and imposes no admission of fault, financial obligation, or ongoing performance requirement on them. 

 

17.3 Additional Remedies 

If any third-party claim is brought or threatened against WhizzOnBy Ltd. that arises from the User’s acts, omissions, or materials, WhizzOnBy Ltd. may, at its discretion: 

suspend or terminate the User’s access to the Platform pending resolution of the matter; 

disable or remove allegedly infringing or unlawful materials; and/or 

withhold account credits or balances to offset any losses reasonably anticipated or incurred as a result of the claim. 

These remedies are in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights available under law or equity. 

 

17.4 Indemnification by WhizzOnBy Ltd. (Limited Scope) 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be obligated to indemnify any User except where required by applicable law. 
If indemnification is required by law, WhizzOnBy Ltd.’s total liability shall be limited to the amount specified in Clause 16.1 (three months’ fees or USD $50, whichever is lower). 

No indemnity shall apply in cases involving: 

user negligence or misconduct; 

breach of these Terms; or 

use of the Platform in combination with unauthorized third-party systems or modifications. 

 

17.5 Survival 

The obligations in this Section 17 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement and shall remain enforceable for the duration of any applicable limitation period allowed under law. 

 

18. Suspension and Termination 

 

18.1 Right of Suspension 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without liability, to suspend or restrict access to the WhizzIQ Platform, in whole or in part, immediately and without prior notice where: 

Non-Payment or Account Irregularity: 
Fees are overdue or payment fails for any reason; 
suspicious or unauthorized billing activity is detected; or 
refund or chargeback claims are initiated. 

Breach of Terms: 
The User or any person under their account violates any provision of these Terms, including misuse of AI tools, infringement of intellectual-property rights, or circumvention of security or usage limits. 

Security or Technical Risk: 
Suspension is necessary to prevent unauthorized access, protect system integrity, or mitigate data-security threats. 

Legal or Regulatory Requirement: 
Continued access would breach applicable law, regulation, governmental order, or the rights of third parties. 

Platform Integrity: 
The User’s activities adversely affect system performance, threaten other users, or compromise WhizzIQ’s infrastructure or reputation. 

Suspension does not release the User from payment obligations accruing during the suspension period. 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. will, where reasonable, provide notice and an opportunity to remedy the cause before suspension takes effect, except where immediate action is required to protect the Platform or comply with law. 

 

18.2 Termination by WhizzOnBy Ltd. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. may terminate a User’s account, subscription, or access to the Platform: 

For Cause: 
Immediately upon material breach of these Terms, non-payment beyond 14 days of invoice date, violation of law, or confirmed abuse of the Platform. 

For Convenience: 
Upon providing at least thirty (30) days’ written notice to the User, where termination is due to product retirement, service consolidation, or strategic business adjustment. 

Upon termination, WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall deactivate access credentials and may, at its discretion, delete or anonymize stored data in accordance with Section 18.4 below. 

 

18.3 Termination by the User 

The User may cancel their subscription or terminate their account at any time through the in-platform billing interface or by submitting a written cancellation notice to support@whizzonby.com. 
Termination by the User shall: 

take effect at the end of the current billing cycle; 

not entitle the User to refunds for any unused portion of the subscription term; and 

require settlement of all outstanding fees and charges prior to closure. 

Following cancellation, the User may export their available data before the effective termination date, as outlined in Section 18.4. 

 

18.4 Data Retention and Deletion Policy 

Upon termination (whether by WhizzOnBy Ltd. or the User): 

Retention Period: 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. will retain User data in an accessible state for thirty (30) days following the effective termination date to allow the User to export or download their information. 

Deletion: 
After the retention period, WhizzOnBy Ltd. will permanently delete or anonymize all User data from active systems and initiate removal from backup storage within an additional sixty (60) days, unless a longer period is required by law or regulatory obligation. 

Exception: 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. may retain limited metadata or transactional records (e.g., billing details, support logs, and compliance evidence) for audit, fraud prevention, or legal-compliance purposes. 

User Responsibility: 
It is the User’s sole responsibility to maintain their own copies of any data or content prior to termination. 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be liable for loss of data after the retention window expires. 

 

18.5 Effect of Termination 

Upon termination for any reason: 

All licenses and rights granted to the User immediately cease; 

Any outstanding payment obligations remain due and payable; 

Access credentials, integrations, and associated services will be disabled; 

All provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive (including Sections 15–17 and 19–21) shall continue in full force and effect. 

 

18.6 Reactivation 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. may, at its sole discretion, allow reactivation of a terminated account upon receipt of outstanding payments, verification of compliance, and written agreement to the then-current Terms and pricing. 

 

19. Changes to the Terms 

 

19.1 Right to Modify 

 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify, amend, or update these Terms of Service at any time to reflect changes in applicable laws, evolving business practices, product functionality, or technical or operational requirements of the WhizzIQ Platform. 
Any such modifications will be legally binding once published and shall supersede all prior versions of these Terms. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. may also issue revisions to associated policies, including the Privacy Policy, Data Processing Agreement (DPA), Cookie Policy, and other related documents, each of which forms part of the overall contractual framework governing use of the Platform. 

 

19.2 Notice of Changes 

When material changes are made, WhizzOnBy Ltd. will provide reasonable advance notice through one or more of the following methods: 

Email Notification sent to the address associated with the User’s account; 

In-app Notification or Banner displayed within the WhizzIQ interface; or 

Public Posting of the revised Terms on the official WhizzIQ website with an updated “Effective Date.” 

The method and timing of notice shall be determined at WhizzOnBy Ltd.’s discretion, consistent with the significance of the changes being introduced. 
For minor updates, clarifications, or administrative modifications that do not materially affect the User’s rights or obligations, advance notice may not be required. 

 

19.3 Effective Date and Continued Use 

Revised Terms shall take effect as of the Effective Date specified in the updated version. 
By continuing to access or use the WhizzIQ Platform after the Effective Date, the User is deemed to have accepted and agreed to be bound by the updated Terms in full. 

If the User does not agree to the modified Terms, they must discontinue all use of the Platform and terminate their account in accordance with Section 18 (Suspension and Termination). 
Continued use following notice constitutes conclusive acceptance of the changes. 

 

19.4 Version Control and Access 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. will maintain an accessible record of the most recent version of these Terms and indicate the last date of revision at the top of the document. 
Users are encouraged to review the Terms periodically to remain informed of any updates. 

The User acknowledges that WhizzOnBy Ltd. may, at its discretion, implement interim modifications in response to urgent legal, regulatory, or security developments without prior notice where such action is necessary to protect the Platform or comply with law. 

 

19.5 No Obligation to Maintain Legacy Versions 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. is under no obligation to continue offering access to prior versions of these Terms, the Platform, or legacy product features after the Effective Date of updated Terms. 
Use of older product versions or discontinued modules shall remain subject to the then-current Terms and applicable policies. 

 

20. Governing Law and Jurisdiction 

 

20.1 Governing Law 

 

These Terms of Service, and any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with them or the WhizzIQ Platform (including any non-contractual obligations), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. operates globally; however, all contractual relationships between the User and WhizzOnBy Ltd. are deemed to be entered into, performed, and enforceable within the jurisdiction of England and Wales. 

 

20.2 Jurisdiction 

Subject to the dispute resolution provisions set out below, the parties irrevocably agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms or their subject matter. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, WhizzOnBy Ltd. retains the right to seek injunctive or equitable relief in any competent court of law to prevent or address actual or threatened infringement, misuse, or breach of its intellectual property, data, or confidentiality rights, wherever such infringement may occur. 

 

20.3 International Users and Local Compliance 

Users accessing the WhizzIQ Platform from outside the United Kingdom are solely responsible for ensuring that their use complies with local laws and regulations. 
Where use of the Platform or its features is prohibited by applicable local law, such access is unauthorized and void. 
By using the Platform, the User represents and warrants that they are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country or territory subject to UK, US, or EU trade sanctions or export restrictions. 

 

20.4 Dispute Resolution and Arbitration (Optional for International Users) 

For Users outside of the United Kingdom, WhizzOnBy Ltd. may, at its discretion, require that disputes be resolved through binding arbitration instead of court proceedings, under the following conditions: 

Governing Rules: 
Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) Rules, which are deemed incorporated by reference into this clause. 

Seat and Venue: 
The seat of arbitration shall be London, England, and the proceedings shall be conducted in the English language. 

Arbitrator: 
The tribunal shall consist of a single independent arbitrator appointed jointly by the parties, or in default of agreement, by the LCIA. 

Confidentiality: 
All arbitration proceedings, filings, evidence, and awards shall be kept strictly confidential by both parties. 

Costs: 
Each party shall bear its own costs and share equally in the administrative and arbitrator fees, unless otherwise determined by the tribunal. 

Interim Measures: 
Either party may apply to any competent court for interim relief (including injunctions) before or during the arbitration process, without waiving its right to arbitration. 

 

20.5 Mediation Option 

Before initiating arbitration or court action, both parties agree to attempt in good faith to resolve disputes through informal negotiation or voluntary mediation, facilitated by a neutral third-party mediator appointed by mutual consent. 
Mediation shall not exceed thirty (30) days from initiation unless extended by mutual written agreement. 

20.6 Time Limitation for Claims 

To the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim arising under or related to these Terms must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. 
Claims filed thereafter shall be permanently barred, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary. 

 

21. Miscellaneous 

 

21.1 Entire Agreement 

 

These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy, Data Processing Agreement (DPA), Cookie Policy, and any other referenced or supplemental agreements, constitute the entire agreement between WhizzOnBy Ltd. and the User regarding access to and use of the WhizzIQ Platform. 

This Agreement supersedes all prior proposals, communications, or understandings, whether written or oral, concerning the same subject matter. 
No purchase-order terms, marketing materials, or other extraneous documents shall modify these Terms unless expressly accepted in writing by an authorized representative of WhizzOnBy Ltd. 

 

21.2 Severability 

If any provision of these Terms is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a competent court, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the remainder shall remain fully valid and enforceable. 
Should any provision be invalidated, WhizzOnBy Ltd. may substitute an enforceable term that most closely reflects the original intent and purpose. 

 

21.3 No Waiver 

Failure or delay by WhizzOnBy Ltd. to exercise any right, power, or remedy under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver thereof. 
Any waiver must be explicit, written, and signed by an authorized officer of WhizzOnBy Ltd. 
A partial or single exercise of any right does not preclude further exercises or the exercise of any other right. 

 

21.4 Assignment and Transfer 

Users may not assign, sublicense, transfer, or convey any rights or obligations under these Terms—including access credentials, subscriptions, or licenses—to any third party without the prior written consent of WhizzOnBy Ltd. 
Any attempted assignment or transfer without consent shall be null and void. 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. may, however, assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, to: 

An affiliate or subsidiary; 

A successor entity in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets; or 

A third party assuming operational control of the WhizzIQ Platform. 

Such assignment shall be effective without requiring notice or consent from Users, provided that the assignee assumes all obligations of WhizzOnBy Ltd. under these Terms. 

 

21.5 Force Majeure 

WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, acts of God, pandemics, war, terrorism, civil unrest, governmental orders, labor disputes, cyber-attacks, power or internet failures, or disruptions involving third-party service providers. 
WhizzOnBy Ltd. shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume full service as soon as feasible after such events. 

 

21.6 Survival 

All clauses which by their nature are intended to survive termination—including, without limitation, those concerning intellectual property, confidentiality, data protection, indemnification, warranties and disclaimers, limitation of liability, and governing law—shall remain in effect following termination or expiration of the User’s access or subscription. 

 

21.7 Headings and Interpretation 

Headings are for reference only and shall not affect interpretation. 
References to “include,” “includes,” or “including” are not limiting. 
The singular shall include the plural and vice versa. 
References to “User” apply equally to individuals, organizations, and other legal entities. 

 

21.8 Relationship of the Parties 

Nothing in these Terms shall create a partnership, joint venture, employment, fiduciary, or agency relationship between the User and WhizzOnBy Ltd. 
Each party acts as an independent contractor, responsible for its own obligations and liabilities. 

 

21.9 Language and Notices 

These Terms are drafted in the English language, which shall prevail in case of any translation inconsistencies. 
All notices or communications required under these Terms shall be provided in English and sent via the channels specified in Section 20 (Contact Information).
